# KirbyML (WIP)
A machine learning project for the video game Kirby's Dream Land for the Nintendo Game Boy.

## About this Project
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning program that is capable of clearing levels in the video game [Kirby's Dream Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirby%27s_Dream_Land) for the Nintendo Game Boy.

I decided to pursue this project so I could learn more about machine learning. As it currently stands, I do not even know if such a goal is even possible.

Kirby is one of my favorite video game series of all time, and I recently developed an interest in machine learning. I thought this project would be a good starting point and a neat way to include some of my interests.
